Running: The runner.sh script runs the python file tikz_generator.py. Normal running is achieved by writing:
         ./runner.sh

Video: If you want to generate an output video call with the argument "video":
       ./runner.sh video

Git: If you want to push to git after having run the script call with the argument "git":
     ./runner.sh git

Video and Git: Arguments can be combined in any permutation, which means that the following are equivalent:
               ./runner.sh git video
               ./runner.sh video git

   KNOWN ISSUES:
1. To run the script runner.sh you must install ImageMagick. Brew:
   brew install imagemagick

2. There might be permission issues with the runner.sh file as well, fix this by typing:
   chmod -x runner.sh

3. Make sure there exists a folder named tex within this folder.
